# Vita SDL2 Examples
SDL2 Examples for the PS Vita 

Contains a few small example application snippets that were useful for porting SDL2 applications to the PS Vita

Requires the [VitaSDK](https://vitasdk.org/) to build and a PSP Vita with [Henkaku](https://henkaku.xyz/) homebrew enabler to run the examples on the console.
